## Overview

üëã Welcome to my first assignment in CPP! This assignment involves creating a class to represent graphs and implementing various algorithms to operate on them.

## Files

- **Graph.cpp**: Contains the implementation of the `Graph` class for graph representation.
- **Algorithms.cpp**: Implements various graph algorithms including `isConnected`, `shortestPath`, `isContainsCycle`, `isBipartite`, and `negativeCycle`.
- **Demo.cpp**: Provides examples demonstrating the usage of implemented classes and algorithms.

## Graph Representation

üîç Graphs are represented using an adjacency matrix, a square matrix where each cell indicates the presence or absence of an edge between two vertices. Diagonal elements represent self-loops, and non-diagonal elements represent edge connections.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **isConnected(g)**:

   - Determines if the given graph `g` is connected.
   - Returns 1 if the graph is connected, otherwise returns 0.

2. **shortestPath(g, start, end)**:

   - Finds the shortest path between the start and end vertices in the graph `g`.
   - Returns the path as a sequence of vertices if exists, otherwise returns -1.

3. **isContainsCycle(g)**:

   - Detects if the given graph `g` contains any cycles.
   - Returns 1 if a cycle exists, otherwise returns 0.

4. **isBipartite(g)**:

   - Checks if the graph `g` can be partitioned into two sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.
   - Returns the partitioning of the graph if bipartite, otherwise returns 0.

5. **negativeCycle(g)**:
   - Identifies if the given graph `g` contains a negative cycle.
   - Prints the negative cycle if exists, otherwise indicates that no negative cycle is present.

## Code Division

üß© The code is divided into three main files:

- **Graph.cpp**: Contains the implementation of the `Graph` class.
- **Algorithms.cpp**: Contains implementations of various graph algorithms.
- **Demo.cpp**: Provides examples demonstrating the usage of implemented classes and algorithms.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the project using the provided Makefile:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```
4. Run the demo program:
   ```bash
   ./demo
   ```
5. Optionally, you can run the tests:
   ```bash
   ./test_counter
   ```

That's it! You should now be able to run the demo program and the tests for this project.
